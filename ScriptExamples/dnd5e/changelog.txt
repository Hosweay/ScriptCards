Change Log for items in the ScriptExamples/dnd5e Folder:

2022-04-18 - 5E Character Action Script - Added the ability to (optionally, of course) track and enforce spell slot limits for PCs. If trackPCSpellSlots is set
             to 1 in the configuraiton section, available spell slots will be used to determine which buttons are displayed on the action menu for spells. It 
             also determines which levels are available from the casting menu when the player clicks a spell button. If the player scrolls back up and tries to
             re-cast from a previously generated action menu and chooses a slot level they no longer have a slot for, they will receive a whispered message
             telling them that they are out of slots for that level. If spell slot tracking is turned on, by default a table of available spell slots is displayed
             above the spellcasting buttons on the menu. This can be turned off by setting showPCSpellSlotList to 0.

2022-03-04 - 5E Themed Macro Button Menu Template 1.0.0 - New script sample that uses a macro mule and a few attributes to generate 5E themed (in display only...
             the script is actually not system-specific) menu of buttons to click the various macros. The macros can be anything that can be placed on a character's
             ability page, including other ScriptCards scripts.

2022-03-04 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.8.1 - Bug fix for healing spells applying damage instead of healing :)

2022-02-27 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.8.0 - Added the "damagebuttons" option and two related options to the settings area. If damage apply type is set to
             "damagebuttons", instead of automatic damage application a row of four buttons will be added to the end of the card or whispered to the DM. Clicking
             these buttons will apply Full, Half, Quarter or Healing damage to the token(s) selected when the button is clicked. This feature requires ScriptCards
             version 1.6.4a or higher.

2022-02-25 - Added another version of 5E Initiative that is fully commented with explanations on what everything in the script does. Functionally it is the same
             as the existing version of the script.

2022-01-27 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.2) - Added Global Damage Modifier support. Added support for damage application (See settings area). Default

             as a .roll20 file so I can use Andreas J.'s Roll20 syntax hilighter for Visual Studio Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anduh.rmacro)
