The examples in this directory are intended for use with the experimental version of ScriptCards that includes support for event triggers.

Please note that a colon (:) is not a valid filename character, so I have replaced them with underscores (_) in the filenames here. These
trigger script should be placed on abilites on your ScriptCards_Triggers character with names matching these filenames, but with colons in
the place of the underscores, so "change:campaign:playerpageid", etc.
