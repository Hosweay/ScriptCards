Change Log for items in the ScriptExamples/system-neutral Folder:

2022-11-21 - Updated TurnOrderFunctions to correct comment on GET_NUMBERED_TURN_INFO (turn number is the LAST parameter), and add REFRESH_TURNORDER_CACHE
             to update the functions view of the turn order if you modify it during the same ScriptCard. Also added GET_TURNORDER_LENGTH, which will
             get the number of entries in the turn tracker.

2022-09-22 - Added FindBumpToken sample functions for retrieving real/shadow tokens from Bump

2022-09-20 - Added ReportStatusMarkers, a simple script to list all of the status markers defined in your game with their image and their full name.

2022-09-04 - Updated StatusMarkerFuntions to include a CLEAR_STATUS_MARKERS function and to ignore counter numbers when adding the "dead" marker.

2022-08-20 - Added StatusMarkerFunctions - an example library of functions for dealing with (adding, removing, looking for) status markers on
             tokens. Supports status markers with counters on them. Limited count of status marker numbers to 0 thru 9

2022-08-13 - Added CustomTurnInfo - Just a quick example to show pulling apart turn tracker entries and working with their components. Requires
             ScriptCards 2.1.6 or higher because it uses string referencing functions to shorten up the code.

2022-03-04 - Themed Macro Button Menu Template 1.0.0 - New script sample that uses a macro mule and a few attributes to generate themed menu of 
             buttons to click the various macros. The macros can be anything that can be placed on a character's ability page, including other ScriptCards scripts.

2022-02-05 - CasinoGames v1.10 - Fixed the check for using the spot bonus in Find the Lady. Added the "Press Your Luck" game

2022-02-04 - CasinoGames v1.01 update. Automatically detects if you have ScriptCards 1.54 or higher and uses new die parser features. Won't use
             those features if you have an older verison of ScriptCards.

2022-02-03 - CasinoGames.Roll20 added
