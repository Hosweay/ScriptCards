Change Log for items in the ScriptExamples/dnd5e Folder:

2022-08-18 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.2
             - Added support for Short/Long rests as buttons in the subtitle area of the action menu. A long rest is more or less a single click, while
               a short rest will bring up a new menu allowing the player to spend hit dice. Warlock packt spells are reovered on a short rest, while a 
               long rest will recover all HP and spell slots. Can be disabled by changing &ShowRestButtons to 0 in the settings area.
             - Removed the default "snail" marker for concentration since it was only there for testing :) You can set a marker in the settings area
               to be applied to tokens when they cast a concentration spell.
             - Incorporated the newly writted status marker support functions to make dealing with status markers more reliable. The only interaction
               with them (for now) is setting a concentration marker.

2022-08-18 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.1
             - Fix for a bug introduced in 2.1.0 that broke toggling gloal modifier states on/off

2022-08-17 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.1.0
             - New option : DetectPlayersToken. If set to 1, the players will not need to select a token manually as long as they control a single
               token on the current Player Page (ribbon page) when executing the Action Menu macro
             - Removed the &#64;{ target masking approach to hiding the target info from Roll20. The old way I was doing it meant that nothing about
               the macro could be edited in the macro editor or the script would prompt for a target becuse Roll20 would screw up the HTML replacements.
               The new method builds a ScriptCards string to substitute for the replacement sequence, which doesn't break when the macro editor is
               reopened on the macro.

2022-08-07 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.12
             - Added the ability to set a status marker when casting spells that require concentration. Set the ConcentrationMarkerName value in the settings
               area to the name of the marker you wish to set when a concentration spell is cast. Note that Spell_Mule spells will need to handle this 
               functionality on their own, as they are not processed by the Action Menu.

2022-08-05 - 5E Character Action menu 2.0.11
             - Damage resistance/vulnerability/immunity now attempts to check for special cases like Silver, Adamant, and Magical damage
             - Bug fix in whispering saving throws to the appropriate targets.
             - Other smaller bug fixes.

2022-07-17 - 5E Magic Missile 2.2
             Exclusively uses ScriptCards to apply damage, since using token-mod or alterbars will only apply damage from one missile if a target is
             selected more than once (order/timing of execution of the scripts gets in the way).

2022-07-09 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.5
             NOTE: This is a major update to the 5E Character Action Menu, and requires the absolute latest version of ScriptCards (2.0.2g at the 
             time of this writing) for all of its features to be supported.
           - Adds checks for damage immunity, vulnerability, and resistances when making attacks or casting spells against NPCs. Currently, I don't 
             see a method for adding this information to the character sheet for PCs - If I'm missing where it is, please let me know :) Attacks that do 
             multiple damage types are handled appropriately based on the type of each damage roll.
           - Implements a per-character options system. Right now, the configuration options are limited to toggling on or off the display of the global 
             modifier buttons and the saves/skills buttons. This is more of a groundwork thing for future modifications. A button will appear in the title 
             bar of the main Action Menu that looks like a small gear. Clicking this will display the customization menu for that character. Options are 
             stored on the character in a new attribute called 5ECAM_SETTINGS.
             
2022-07-05 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.1 - Spell Prep checks are now skipped for Warlocks in addition to Sorcerers.

2022-07-04 - 5E Character Action Menu 2.0.0 
             - Changed the defaults for some of the optional features to enable them. Please check these settings before upgrading and customize as needed
             - Tweaked the colors and theme slightly to improve the default appearance of the menus. 
             - Added Global Save Modifiers toggle buttons. 
             - Added "Skill Check" and "Saving Throw" buttons to the main action menu. Can be enabled/disabled for PCs and NPCs separately in settings. These
               saving throws will take global save modifiers that are currently enable into account.
             - Used the new 2.0.2d buttonpadding setting to alter the size of the buttons on the menu, making the global modifier buttons considerably smaller.
               Both the standard buttons and the small button sizes are customizable in the settings area.
             - Modified the self-handle advantage mode to show the current advantage mode by colorizing the appropriate button instead of printing the text.
             - Added option (on by default) to use a more compact display mode for the "Global X Saves" sections.

2022-05-28 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.9.0 - In response to a forum request by user John D., the Action Menu now includes support for toggling Global
             attack and damage modifiers on or off right from the action menu. If &showGlobalModifierButtons is set to 1 in the settings area (as with
             most/all new features, it is off by default), the action menu will display a summary of the character's defined Global Attack and Global
             Damage modifiers as buttons at the top of the menu. Active modifiers will have green buttons, while inactive modifiers will have red buttons.
             Clicking one of the buttons will toggle that modifier and redisplay the menu. NOTE: There is a wierdness/bug in Roll20 that can prevent
             setting attributes via the API that have never been initialized on the character sheet. This means that these buttons won't be able to toggle
             on a modifier that has never been toggled on from the character sheet. Manually toggling a modifier on and off once should fix this permanently.
             There were also a couple of small font/style changes to make things (especially for characters with lots of abilities) look a bit nicer.

2022-05-25 - 5E Character Action Menu. Thanks to JustinG for catching that spell names with more than one space in them wouldn't be found on a spell mule.
             Updated the code to allow this to work.

2022-04-18 - 5E Character Action Script - Added the ability to (optionally, of course) track and enforce spell slot limits for PCs. If trackPCSpellSlots is set
             to 1 in the configuraiton section, available spell slots will be used to determine which buttons are displayed on the action menu for spells. It 
             also determines which levels are available from the casting menu when the player clicks a spell button. If the player scrolls back up and tries to
             re-cast from a previously generated action menu and chooses a slot level they no longer have a slot for, they will receive a whispered message
             telling them that they are out of slots for that level. If spell slot tracking is turned on, by default a table of available spell slots is displayed
             above the spellcasting buttons on the menu. This can be turned off by setting showPCSpellSlotList to 0.

2022-03-04 - 5E Themed Macro Button Menu Template 1.0.0 - New script sample that uses a macro mule and a few attributes to generate 5E themed (in display only...
             the script is actually not system-specific) menu of buttons to click the various macros. The macros can be anything that can be placed on a character's
             ability page, including other ScriptCards scripts.

2022-03-04 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.8.1 - Bug fix for healing spells applying damage instead of healing :)

2022-02-27 - 5E Character Action Menu 1.8.0 - Added the "damagebuttons" option and two related options to the settings area. If damage apply type is set to
             "damagebuttons", instead of automatic damage application a row of four buttons will be added to the end of the card or whispered to the DM. Clicking
             these buttons will apply Full, Half, Quarter or Healing damage to the token(s) selected when the button is clicked. This feature requires ScriptCards
             version 1.6.4a or higher.

2022-02-25 - Added another version of 5E Initiative that is fully commented with explanations on what everything in the script does. Functionally it is the same
             as the existing version of the script.

2022-02-24 - 5E Initiative (1.0) - A script to roll initiative for one or more selected tokens and add them to the turn tracker.

2022-02-19 - 5E Dragon Breath (1.5.6) - Updated to include dragon types from Fizban's Treasury of Dragons. Option settings for what type of saves to use.

2022-01-31 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.6) - Code efficiency improvements, now takes custom crit damage into account if used.

2022-01-31 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.5) - Fixed bugs related to critical hit detection and use of character attributes for attack/damage rolls.
               REQUIRES ScriptCards 1.5.8+

2022-01-27 - 5E Character Action Menu (1.7.2) - Added Global Damage Modifier support. Added support for damage application (See settings area). Default
             is to NOT attempt to apply damage. Note that resistances, etc. are not currently figured into damage calculations. Renamed file on the repo 
             as a .roll20 file so I can use Andreas J.'s Roll20 syntax hilighter for Visual Studio Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anduh.rmacro)

2022-01-10 - 5e Burning Hands (1.6) - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play.
             5e Lightning Bolt (1.4) - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play. Corrected offset VFX.
             5e Dragonborn Breath (1.5) - Added support for direct object modification for damage application. Added definable sound effect to play. Corrected offset VFX.

             5e Character Action Menu (1.7.1) - Added logic to apply proficiency bonus even if the character sheet has not properly set the atkprofflag attribute.

2022-01-02 - 5e Burning Hands (1.5) - Added logic to ensure damage is applied in the correct direction (ie, not healing).
           - 5e Character Action Menu (1.7.0) - NPC Spellcasting can now be set to be whispered to sender by setting AllNPCActionsToSender to 1
