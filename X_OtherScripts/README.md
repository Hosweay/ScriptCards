# Other Scripts
This folder contains random other Roll20 API scripts that folks might find helpful, generally created in response to requests on the forum.

## APIAlerter.js
A simple script that displays a message when your API Sandbox starts or restarts. Useful for knowing if you had a sandbox crash mid-game.

## EncounterHelper.js
This script allows you to define "encounters", or sets of tokens/game objects. You can then click a button to either show or hide all of the
items associated with the encounter to the layer they were on when the encounter was defined. Essentially this means you can set up your
encounters how you want them to play out, define EncounterHelper encounters for them, and then use EH to move them to the GM layer during
game prep. At play time, you can click a button to bring them back to the token (or map or walls) layers.
